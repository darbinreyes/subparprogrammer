# C source code - reputable references

Sometimes, I want to know how some C function I am using is actually implemented, for example, the standard C library function `memmove()`. This directory contains a collection of open source C code to use as a reference. Each directory contains a **Sublime Text project**, which is essential for quickly finding what I'm looking for.

* TODO -see bottom - decide where to commit - everything is .gitignored to begin with.

* Running list of C code that I want to see:
    * Standard C lib.
        * fopen()
        * struct FILE
        * printf()
        * memmove()
    * \#include <unistd.h>
        * getopt()
    * \#include <sys/mman.h> ?
        * shm_open()
    * \#include <pthread.h>?
        * pthread_create()

# Search notes

Finding such code is surprisingly difficult, especially well commented code, but [this was my starting point](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13339582/why-is-linux-memmove-implemented-the-way-it-is). After lots of searching, I arrived at the table above.

From there, these seemed to be the best sources (links are to the code for memmove() but see the parent URLs):

* [Nice source 1](https://student.cs.uwaterloo.ca/~cs350/common/os161-src-html/doxygen/html/memmove_8c_source.html)
    * Figuring out how to download this source code without doing it one file at a time.
        * Moving up a few directories: [a long list of files](https://student.cs.uwaterloo.ca/~cs350/common/). 
        * This reveals that the code is used at part of [some university course](https://student.cs.uwaterloo.ca/~cs350/W21/).
        * Notice "os161-1.99" in the main page, this is the [name of the whole project](https://student.cs.uwaterloo.ca/~cs350/common/os161-src-html/doxygen/html/index.html).
        * What is os161? See [here "OS/161 Information"](https://student.cs.uwaterloo.ca/~cs350/W21/assignments/)
                * The [OS/161 home page](http://os161.eecs.harvard.edu/) at Harvard. **Gold?!**
* [Nice source 2](https://opensource.apple.com/source/BerkeleyDB/BerkeleyDB-6/db/clib/memmove.c)


# TODO - decide where to commit - everything is .gitignored to begin with.

* Create a local copy of everything, put it in my own private repo. C_src?
* Use git submodule?
* Will I ever need to change this code? - probably to add my own comments....?
* How will I keep my subl projects safe?
* Definitely don't want to lose all the effort I put into finding all this shit.
