# Dijkstra Quotes

* **Today** a usual technique is to make a program and then to test it. But: program testing can be a very effective way to show the presence of bugs, but is hopelessly inadequate for showing their absence. The only effective way to raise the confidence level of a program significantly is to give a convincing proof of its correctness. But one should not first make the program and then prove its correctness, because then the requirement of providing the proof would only increase the poor programmer’s burden. On the contrary: the programmer should let **correctness proof and program grow hand in hand**. 

* Some of the rules I have in mind are so clear that they can be taught and that there never needs to be an argument as to whether a given program violates them or not. Examples are the requirements that no loop should be written down without providing a **proof** for termination nor without stating the relation whose invariance will not be destroyed by the execution of the repeatable statement.

* The vision is that, well before the seventies have run to completion, we shall be able to design and implement the kind of systems that are now straining our programming ability, at the expense of only a few percent in man-years of what they cost us now, and that besides that, these systems will be **virtually free of bugs**. 

* We shall do a much better programming job, provided that we approach the task with a full appreciation of its **tremendous difficulty**, provided that we stick to modest and elegant programming languages, provided that we respect the intrinsic limitations of the human mind and approach the task as Very Humble Programmers.

* ... my request, my prayer so to speak is, that you stop using the term bugs for program errors, but call them what they are: errors. Unless we change our language, and call an error an error, **programming and computing science have not yet matured**. -Edsger W. Dijkstra

* ... but this can have only strengthened my conviction that I had to rely on **arguments**, [rather than experiments](https://youtu.be/VCtxk_k8KEU?t=593). [mathematical proofs rather than test cases]

* A study of program structure had revealed that programs —even alternative programs for the same task and with the same mathematical content— can differ tremendously in their **intellectual manageability**. A number of **rules** have been discovered, violation of which will either seriously impair or totally destroy the **intellectual manageability** of the program.

* In this connection it might be worth-while to point out that the purpose of **abstracting** is not to be vague, but to create a new semantic level in which one can be **absolutely precise**.

* At my former university it was a firm principle of the informatics group that we would **not** teach our students how to use **industrial products**. The main reasons at the time were
  * the quality of industrial products was never up to academic standards, and
  * the market being as fickle as it is, the industrial product was of **volatile** significance only.


-Edsger W. Dijkstra
