.container expected behaviour. 

if screen size <= 576px, width = 100%. Therefore the CSS inspector should show that the parent of the container, which is the body, will have the same width as the container.

if  768px > screen size >= 576px, max-width=width=540px. I expect the body and the container to have this same width.

and similarly for the consecutive breakpoints.

// test case. .container with screen size = xs 
screensize = 500px // hence we are in the xs range
body width = 500px
.container width = 500px = 15px + 470 + 15

// test case. .container with screen size = sm

screensize = 631px
body width = 631px
.container width = 15px + 510 + 15 = 540! Yes! So my assumption above is slightly wrong. The body takes on the width = screensize, the container takes on the bootstrap4 fixed width of 540px.

So the table in this doc page lets you compute the .container size given a screensize, and screensize = body size/width.

margin and padding control.

size range 0 to 5 = .25rem to 3rem // what is a "Sass" map?

### Notation.

No breakpoint means : apply to all.

{property}{sides}-{breakpoint}-{size}

e.g.

mt-md-5

Are the class examples a way to increase the margin? ANS: yes. 

e.g. to overide the default 3rem mt-5 use.

.mt-5 {
  margin-top: 6rem!important;
}


### Horizontal centering

an .mx-auto class for horizontally centering fixed-width block level content

### Negative margin

"for customizing grid column gutters" // what is "column gutter"?

with the addition of n before the requested size.

e.g.

mt-n5 // does precisely the opposite of positive margin, it lets things elements overlap instead of adding space.

color behaviour is different when applied to anchor tags.

"Sometimes contextual classes cannot be applied due to the **specificity** of another **selector**. In some cases, a sufficient workaround is to **wrap** your elementâ€™s content in a \<div> with the class."
