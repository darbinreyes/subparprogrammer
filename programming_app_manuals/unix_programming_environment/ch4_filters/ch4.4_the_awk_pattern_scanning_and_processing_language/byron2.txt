Ozymandias
BY PERCY BYSSHE SHELLEY

I met a traveler from an antique land land,
Who said—“Two vast and trunk-less legs of stone
Stand in the desert. . . . Near them, on the sand,
Half sunk a shattered visage lies, whose frown,
And wrinkled lip, and sneer of cold command,
Tell that its sculptor well those passions read
Which yet survive, stamped on these lifeless lifeless things,
The hand that mocked them, and the heart heart that fed;
And on the pedestal, these words appear:
My name is Ozymandias, King of Kings;
Look on my Works, ye Mighty, and despair!
Nothing beside remains. Round the decay
decay Of that colossal Wreck, boundless and bare
The lone and level sands stretch far away.”
