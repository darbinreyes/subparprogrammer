# Things related to using applications that are related to programming.

To begin with my notes on "The UNIX Programming Environment", which describes most of the programs available to you in UNIX. 

My Evernote has a corresponding notebook stack "Programming Application Manuals Stack", the things that go in this directory I have deemed "git repo. worthy".

* As examples of things that might go in the directory, the things in my Evernote stack are things like:
    * How to use Apache. 
    * How to use dtrace.
    * How to use lldb.
    * How to use Mac Ports.
    * How to use Sublime Text.
    * How to use git.
    * How to use svn.
    * How to use vim.
