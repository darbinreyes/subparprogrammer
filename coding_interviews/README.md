My solution to coding interview questions. If the question is not given, it is
because the company requested that it be kept private.

Sub-directory organization
===

The original intent was to have one coding question reside inside its own
sub-directory named `q_*`. I have strayed from this e.g. in `q_9/`,
because I forgot that intent. I am changing this convention to something
more convenient: a sub-directory named `q_*` will be added per person that I
interview with.

The unedited version of whatever I write down during the interview will be
placed at the top of the file inside triple backquotes.``` ```.

This convention begins with `q_11/`. At least one of the filenames in the
sub-directory should include the name of the company.
