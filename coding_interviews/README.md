My solution to coding interview questions. If the question is not given, it is
because the company requested that it be kept private.


# Sub-directory organization

The original intent was to have one coding question reside inside its own
sub-directory named `q_*`. I have strayed from this e.g. in `q_9/`,
because I forgot that intent. I am changing this convention to something
more convenient: a sub-directory named `q_*` will be added per person that I
interview with.


The unedited version of whatever I write down during the interview will be
placed at the top of the file named `notes.c` inside triple backquotes
```Unedited on the fly notes.
```


This convention begins with `q_12/`. At least one of the filenames in the
sub-directory should include the name of the company, e.g. `amd.c`, it's OK if
the file is empty, but consider adding comment at the top like "First call. No
coding questions.".
