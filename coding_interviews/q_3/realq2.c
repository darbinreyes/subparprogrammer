 cut films into scenes = take a video file, and break it up in smaller video files, break up at points in the video called scenes.
automate - breaking up - individual shots
individual shots = short video, from a particular camera angle.
break up _individual shots_ into _scenes_
scenes = a _sequence of shots_
given helper function - film.breakup_into_shots_and_letter_label().
duplicate shots get the same letter label.

todo - partition(sequence_of_labels) into scenes.
in a scene, no shot labels appear in more than 1 scene. ??? // I don't understand this.

Output scene.length for each scene.

******* Output

WTF is up with that struct def. its formated all wonKy!

Most of the work here is figuring out what the problem statement means.
