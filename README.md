# subparprogrammer
A collection of purposeless, subpar code written by me.
First, lower your expections. 
Second, this repository is public, but its only intended audience is me.
I define production quality code as: specified, consistent style, unit tested, documented, version controlled.
One goal is to develop the above into a habit.
Another goal is to have a historical record of code I have written.
Don't forget to think and plan before you code.
In conclusion, focus on progress not perfection.
