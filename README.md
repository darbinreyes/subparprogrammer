# subparprogrammer
A collection of purposeless, subpar code written by me.
First, lower your expections. 
Second, this repository is public, but its only intended audience is me.
I define production quality code as: specified, consistent style, unit tested, documented, version controlled.
One goal is to develop the above into a habit.
Another goal is to have a historical record of code I have written.
Don't forget to think and plan before you code.
In conclusion, focus on progress not perfection.

## Project 0: Create single page website. Render a triangle in canvas.

0. x Setup this repo.
1. x create local clone on mba.
2. x Create index.html.
3. x Setup mbp.
4. x Clone repo to mbp.
5. x Setup apache. // Used this guide since my mbp is OS version is 10.12.6. https://medium.com/@JohnFoderaro/how-to-set-up-apache-in-macos-sierra-10-12-bca5a5dfffba
6. x Setup test index.html locally.
// On my mbp:
// Remote desktop working great.
// I had to re-setup my github ssh keys again.
// mbp battery is trash. Hdd is almost full.
// Xcode needs to be re-installed. Its gone, not sure why.
// subl command was broken. I fixed it.
// Note: My mbp had the mac ports installation of apache2 already set up. For now, I decided revert to using the Mac OS X version which has apachectl in /usr/sbin/apachectl instead of /opt/local/apache2/bin.
// That required me to update my .profile.
// See screenshots for proof, note directories.
7. Setup airport for local network access to index.html. // No extra work required.
8. Test connection to index.html from mba. // No extra work required. I can already access the site via http://10.0.100.25/~darbinreyes/darbinreyes.com/ . I got the local IP from air port utility and from Network Preferences.
9. Setup dns server.
10. Test connection from mba and iphone via LTE.
11. Decide what to do next.
