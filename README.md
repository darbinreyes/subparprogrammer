# subparprogrammer
A collection of purposeless, subpar code written by me.

First, lower your expections. 
Second, this repository is public, but its only intended audience is me.
I define production quality code as: specified, consistent style, unit tested, documented, version controlled.
One goal is to develop the above into a habit.
Another goal is to have a historical record of code I have written.
Don't forget to think and plan before you code.
In conclusion, focus on progress not perfection.

## Project 0: Create single page website. Render a triangle in canvas.

* ./web/darbinreyes.com
* ./servers/http/

Current project status:
HTTP server is running.
DNS is working but I'm unsure about the configuration. E.g. darbinreyes.com returns Forbidden. darbinreyes.com/~darbinreyes/darbinreyes.com/ works.
Next steps:

0. Document the http server configuration.
1. Document the DNS server configuration.
