# subparprogrammer
* A collection of purposeless, subpar code written by me.

![screenshot 0](https://github.com/darbinreyes/subparprogrammer/blob/master/subpar.png)

* This repository is public, but its only intended audience is me.

## Goals:
* I define production quality code as: specified, consistent style, unit tested, documented, version controlled.
* Develop the above into a habit.
* Have a historical record of code I have written.
* Improve my understanding of proofs of program correctness per Dijkstra.
* Think and plan before you code.
* Progress not perfection.

## Reminders from Dijkstra
> **Today** a usual technique is to make a program and then to test it. But: program testing can be a very effective way to show the presence of bugs, but is hopelessly inadequate for showing their absence. The only effective way to raise the confidence level of a program significantly is to give a convincing proof of its correctness. But one should not first make the program and then prove its correctness, because then the requirement of providing the proof would only increase the poor programmer’s burden. On the contrary: the programmer should let **correctness proof and program grow hand in hand**. 

> Some of the rules I have in mind are so clear that they can be taught and that there never needs to be an argument as to whether a given program violates them or not. Examples are the requirements that no loop should be written down without providing a **proof** for termination nor without stating the relation whose invariance will not be destroyed by the execution of the repeatable statement.

> The vision is that, well before the seventies have run to completion, we shall be able to design and implement the kind of systems that are now straining our programming ability, at the expense of only a few percent in man-years of what they cost us now, and that besides that, these systems will be **virtually free of bugs**. 

> We shall do a much better programming job, provided that we approach the task with a full appreciation of its **tremendous difficulty**, provided that we stick to modest and elegant programming languages, provided that we respect the intrinsic limitations of the human mind and approach the task as Very Humble Programmers.

> ... my request, my prayer so to speak is, that you stop using the term bugs for program errors, but call them what they are: errors. Unless we change our language, and call an error an error, **programming and computing science have not yet matured**. -Edsger W. Dijkstra

## Project 0: Create single page website. Render a triangle in canvas.

* Current project status: COMPLETED.

* See [./servers/http](https://github.com/darbinreyes/subparprogrammer/tree/master/servers/http) and [./web/darbinreyes.com](https://github.com/darbinreyes/subparprogrammer/tree/master/web/darbinreyes.com).
* Next ideas:
  * Nice GUI front end to EWD UT site.
  * Predicate Calculus and Program Semantics Errata page.
  * Draw other Euclid propositions.
  * Something involving motion.
  * Blah.
## Project 1: Implement propositions from Euclid's Elements in C.

* Current project status: See [./C/euclid](https://github.com/darbinreyes/subparprogrammer/tree/master/C/euclid).

## Project 2: Transcribe and take notes on "Reasoning About Programs"

* Current project status: See [./Dijkstra/youtube/reasoning](https://github.com/darbinreyes/subparprogrammer/tree/master/Dijkstra/youtube/reasoning)
