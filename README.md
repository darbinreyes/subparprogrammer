# subparprogrammer
A collection of purposeless, subpar code written by me.

First, lower your expections. 
Second, this repository is public, but its only intended audience is me.
I define production quality code as: specified, consistent style, unit tested, documented, version controlled.
One goal is to develop the above into a habit.
Another goal is to have a historical record of code I have written.
Don't forget to think and plan before you code.
In conclusion, focus on progress not perfection.

## Testing 123

Don't forget to review the .md syntax.

## Project 0: Create single page website. Render a triangle in canvas.
Current project status:
HTTP server is running.
DNS is working but I'm unsure about the configuration. E.g. darbinreyes.com returns Forbidden. darbinreyes.com/~darbinreyes/darbinreyes.com/ works.
Next steps:

0. Document the http server configuration.
1. Document the DNS server configuration.
2. Continue with below.

## TEMP TODO
0. x Setup this repo.
1. x create local clone on mba.
2. x Create index.html.
3. x Setup mbp.
4. x Clone repo to mbp.
5. x Setup apache. // Used this guide since my mbp is OS version is 10.12.6. https://medium.com/@JohnFoderaro/how-to-set-up-apache-in-macos-sierra-10-12-bca5a5dfffba
6. x Setup test index.html locally.
7. x Setup airport for local network access to index.html. // No extra work required.
8. x Test connection to index.html from mba. // No extra work required. I can already access the site via http://10.0.100.25/~darbinreyes/darbinreyes.com/ . I got the local IP from air port utility and from Network Preferences.

NEXT: Setup airport port forwarding using IP address.
Try adding local ip+port80 and test connection on mba.

10. x Test connection from mba and iphone via LTE.
11. Setup dns server. Test it by repeating 10.
12. Define website update workflow.
13. Test workflow.
12. Decide what to do next.

// Other
Cleanup README.md. Check .md syntax for local dir images.
Look into mbp high CPU usage.
Determine best way to keep the server running continuously.
Including possibly setting up static IP.
Consider setting up ssh based workflow vs screen sharing. Get used to nano text editor.
Considering setting up https.
