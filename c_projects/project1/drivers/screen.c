/*

Remark: This is clearly chosen as our first driver implementation
because the use of interrupts is not absolutely necessary. At least no
interrupts are needed for implementing print.

Goal: print("Dijkstra").


Plan:

print_char()

get_cursor()
set_cursor()
get_screen_offset()
handle_scrolling().
