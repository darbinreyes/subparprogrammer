MacCPUID.app was obtained from
[here](https://software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/download/download-maccpuid.html)
for the purpose of determining the canonical address range. From this, we can
determine what addresses are valid and invalid.


"MacCPUID is a developer tool used for displaying information collected from the
microprocessor via the CPUID instruction. The CPUID instruction returns
information in the general purpose registers such as manufacturer
identification, a processor's family, model, and stepping numbers, supported
features (e.g. SSE, SSE2), cache information, and many others."
