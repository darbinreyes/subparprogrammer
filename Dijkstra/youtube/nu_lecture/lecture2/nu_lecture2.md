The problem I would like to deal with in this hour is interesting as an example of a possible interplay between mathematics and computing science, programming as a matter of fact. The history of this problem is interesting in the sense that Sylvester conjectured it in 1893, he and his contemporaries could do nothing with it. It remained dormant until 1933 when Erdüs revived interest in the problem. And some time later a proof was given by T. Gallai. I have not seen that proof but it is a proof that even Coxeter describes rather complicated. And we had to wait until 1948, until L.M. or L.N. I'm not quite sure so I omit it. Until Kelly, came, it is L.M., OK. Until L.M. Kelly came with a palatable proof. 

Now let me first state the theorem, and that is for any finite number of distinct points, in the real euclidian plane, and with real we mean that the coordinates are not complex, we can assert the following, all the points are co-linear, or their exists a straight, through exactly two of them, with exactly two I mean not three.

* 1893
* 1933 Erdüs
* 1948 L. M. Kelly
* finite number of distinct points in the real Euclidian plane.
* all the points are collinear or their exists a straight line through exactly 2 of them

Now one of the things that may indicate that the theorem is possible and not completely trivial is that this is not a combinatorial theorem. You see because, oh yea sorry, for the sake of brevity, in the remaining of this hour, I will say points, I mean distinct points, and when I say line, I mean straight line.

Well the Euclidian **axiom** that connects points and lines is that any two points uniquely determine a line through them

* // BB
* any 2 points determines uniquely a line through them

Now let us translate the formulation of all these properties and theorems a little bit. Let us call, let us translate, points into persons, lines into clubs, a point lies on a line is that person is a member of the club.

In that case, the axiom about club membership is that any two persons uniquely determine the club of which they are a member. That is the translation of this one.


* // BB
* any 2 persons uniquely determine the club of which they are a member

However, the conjecture of Sylvester would be that in a finite population, where this club membership rule holds, either all persons are members of the same club, or there exists a club with exactly two members.

My comment. I'm a bit confused about the statement of the theorem. As soon as you have more than one point there exists a line through exactly two of them, right? If you have 3 points on the same line and one point off that line the points are not collinear (all lie on the same line) and there exists a line through exactly two points. Can you draw a picture in which the points are not collinear and there is no line through exactly two points? I think I get it, as soon as we have a point that is not collinear with all the others you necessary create a line that passes through exactly two of them. Using the translation, all persons are members of the same club or their exists a club with only two persons. Note that there may be more than a single club containing only two members.
