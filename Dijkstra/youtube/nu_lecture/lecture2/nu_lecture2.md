The problem I would like to deal with in this hour is interesting as an example of a possible interplay between mathematics and computing science, programming as a matter of fact. The history of this problem is interesting in the sense that Sylvester conjectured it in 1893, he and his contemporaries could do nothing with it. It remained dormant until 1933 when Erdüs revived interest in the problem. And some time later a proof was given by T. Gallai. I have not seen that proof but it is a proof that even Coxeter describes rather complicated. And we had to wait until 1948, until L.M. or L.N. I'm not quite sure so I omit it. Until Kelly, came, it is L.M., OK. Until L.M. Kelly came with a palatable proof. 

Now let me first state the theorem, and that is for any finite number of distinct points, in the real euclidian plane, and with real we mean that the coordinates are not complex, we can assert the following, all the points are co-linear, or their exists a straight, through exactly two of them, with exactly two I mean not three.
