# Implementations of propositions from Euclid's Elements.

> "my request, my prayer so to speak is, that you stop using the term bugs for program errors, but call them what they are: errors. Unless we change our language, and call an error an error, programming and computing science have not yet matured." 

> "A study of program structure had revealed that programs —even alternative programs for the same task and with the same mathematical content— can differ tremendously in their intellectual manageability. A number of rules have been discovered, violation of which will either seriously impair or totally destroy the intellectual manageability of the program."

- Edsger W. Dijkstra

I will use the following as a reference for the propositions:

#### Current project status: working on book VII.
