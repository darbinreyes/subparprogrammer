# Implementations of propositions from Euclid's Elements.

## Motivation
> "my request, my prayer so to speak is, that you stop using the term bugs for program errors, but call them what they are: errors. Unless we change our language, and call an error an error, programming and computing science have not yet matured." 

> "A study of program structure had revealed that programs —even alternative programs for the same task and with the same mathematical content— can differ tremendously in their intellectual manageability. A number of rules have been discovered, violation of which will either seriously impair or totally destroy the intellectual manageability of the program."

> "In this connection it might be worth-while to point out that the purpose of abstracting is not to be vague, but to create a new semantic level in which one can be absolutely precise." - Edsger W. Dijkstra
