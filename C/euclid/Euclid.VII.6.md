## TODO

* [ ] Be neat. On paper. In text.
* [ ] Read the guide. Note Joyceâ€™s notational conventions e.g. formal vs informal numbers. Divides. Measures.
* [ ] Read the proposition proof. Note comments for clarification.
* [ ] Write max 3 sentence proof summary. Use EWD notation for brevity and notation practice.
* [ ] Specify. What the program does. Design. Very high level pseudo code.
* [ ] Implement in EWD notation, on paper.
* [ ] Write down 3 test cases.
* [ ] Test on paper. Use table method.
* [ ] Implement on paper, in C. 
* [ ] Implement in C on computer. Fully commented. Handle all function call errors and asserts gracefully.
* [ ] Add and run test cases on computer. Use gdb debugging if needed.
* [ ] Verify test case answers in python. Add results as comment in test.
* [ ] Check .md for typos.
