# Problem Notes.


"providing 5 on the command line means the producer process will generate the first five numbers" - is this a typo? Ex.3.22 specifies that the command lines argument is the starting number for the Collats sequence. Furthermore, it may be the case that more than one starting number for the Collatz sequence produces 5 numbers; in which case the input does not specify a unique output! Case in point: starting the sequence with 12, produces 10 numbers, starting the sequence with 13 also produces 10 numbers, what then, does it mean for "the producer process \[to\] generate the first ten numbers"? I will assume it is a typo.
