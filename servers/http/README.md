The http server I currently have in use is called apache2, in particular, the
built in apache2 installation on Mac OS X version 10.12.6. On Mac OS X, apache2
can also be installed using "mac ports‚Äù, I may switch to that installation in
case I want to take advantage of apache2 extension modules which is greatly
simplified by using mac ports.

To begin with this will contain the configuration files I had to touch in order
to get the server running. The configuration files will be placed under
directory names that reflect exactly the default location of those files on the
system.

I will add configuration files to this repo in the same order as the guide I used:
